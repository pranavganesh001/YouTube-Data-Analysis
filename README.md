# YouTube-Data-Analysis

YouTube is one of the leading data streaming platforms where a lot of people share and watch content. This platform has a lot of content creators who share videos of various kinds in various formats and generate a huge amount of data every single second. A platform with such a high user base and generating huge amounts of data will have some data missing and a lot of hidden insights that may be useful for decision-making. In our project, we have applied some of the data processing techniques to get rid of the missing values and have performed data visualization to discover some insights about the platform. The insights obtained from the visualization are useful for discovering what topics are trending and what people are watching more often so that the recommendation system of YouTube can be improved. Our project aims to discover new insights about the platform and implement them to improve the user experience so that the users get the best experience when compared to the rival platforms.
